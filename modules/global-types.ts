/**
 * Registers the layer's ambient global types (`app/types/index.ts`) as a
 * TypeScript reference in consumers' generated `.nuxt` types.
 *
 * The types file declares all shared globals (`MenuItem`, `TabOption`,
 * `ButtonVariant`, `DialogComponent`, `FontSize`, …) via `declare global`, but
 * it is never imported. When a consumer extends this layer, the layer lives
 * under `node_modules`, which the consumer's Nuxt-generated tsconfig excludes,
 * so TypeScript never loads the file and every global fails to resolve.
 *
 * A reference is resolved regardless of `include`/`exclude`, and because the
 * file stays in place its relative `.vue` imports keep resolving.
 *
 * This module is picked up automatically: Nuxt scans each layer's `modules/`
 * directory and registers what it finds by absolute path, so it runs in both
 * this repo and any consumer that extends the layer. It is deliberately NOT
 * listed in `nuxt.config`'s `modules` array — a relative entry like
 * `'./modules/global-types'` there resolves against the *consumer's* root and
 * fails to load when the layer is extended.
